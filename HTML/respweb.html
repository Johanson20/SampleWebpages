<h2>Opening Paragraphs</h2>
<p>Several recommendations have been proposed by the city council of Smithville to improve visibility of their police force. Some of these include measures aimed at increasing their number by recruiting new officers, offering incentives for working overtime and encouraging more foot patrols than vehicular patrols by the police. However, the author automatically assumes these proposed measures are sufficient to significantly reduce crime rate and improve the safety rating of the citizens.</p><br>
<p>Tusk university is envisioning a future increase in its students body to approximately twice its current number in a decade, and deems it fit to build new recreational facilities to better serve its current and future students. Their basis provided for this conclusion is the likelihood of increased pressure on existing facilities by an increased students' body and believe with the rising costs of health and recreational club enrollments in the community, students' preferences for usage of the school's facilities would certainly increase. This argument begs a lot of questions as it is founded on several assumptions.</p><br>
<p>The argument asserts increased profit earnings for companies who advertise with Cable Communication Corps. This conclusion was founded on the basis of an
increase in sales of Adam Car Delearship 30 days after advertising with them, and positive customer rating of new cars purchases relative to other car purchases from other car dealers. This argument is founded on a lot of assumptions and hence, is unconvincing.</p><br>

<h2>Concluding paragraphs</h2>
<p>Consequently, the glaring lack of evidence by the author in positing improved police visibility would significantly reduce crime rates in the city, makes his argument skeptical and must be taken with a pinch of salt, until evidence is provided justifying a negative correlation between their increased presence and crime rate. Furthermore, proof of improved citizens' safety rating being dependent on reduced crime rate and references to a similar city where such has been implemented and succeeded, must be provided before forming a more credulous conclusion.</p><br>
<p>Conclusively, the numerous assumptions in the author's claims makes this arguments less credible and hence, the school should reflect upon its decision to construct new recreational facilities, as this might not necessarily attract more athletic talents unless their intent for prioritising schools is established. Furthermore, current recreational usage and interest by students isn't established and unless such information is available, we cannot conclude a growing students body would necessitate construction of new facilities.</p><br>
<p>Consequently, the claims of the argument is largely unconvincing as there are a lot of assumptions made, for which evidence must be provided for proper analysis and inference. Unless, we can prove the advertising deal was directly responsible for the 15% increase in sales and be certain that the increased sales translates to  improved profit margins, we must remain skeptical about the claims of this argument. Additionally, if proof of improved satisfaction from new car deals while  advertising with cable communications can be proven and the circumstances that led to improved profit with adam car dealership, if such happened, can be replicated in any other company, then the conclusion of this argument would be acceptable.</p><br>
