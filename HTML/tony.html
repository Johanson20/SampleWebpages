<p>Well I made it 12,000 miles already, and I passed through some interesting places on the way:</p> 
<ol>
<li>Walla Walla, WA</li>
<li>Magic City, ID</li>
<li>Bountiful, UT</li>
<li>Last Chance, CO</li>
<li>Why, AZ</li>
<li>Truth or consequences, NM</li>
</ol>

<h2>July 14, 2012</h2>
<p>I saw some Burma shave style signs on the road today:</p>
<blockquote>
<br>Passing cars,
<br>When you can't see,
<br>May get you,
<br>A glimpse,
<br>Of eternity. 
<br>I definitely won't be passing any cars.

<p>My first day of the trip! I can't believe I finally got everything packed and ready to go. 
Because am on a segway. I wasn't able to bring a whole lot with me: cellphone, iPod, digital camera, and a protein bar. 
Just the essentials. As Lao Tzu would have said, <q>A journey of a thousand miles begins with one Segway</q>
